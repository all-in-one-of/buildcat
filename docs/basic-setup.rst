Basic Setup
===========

Follow these instructions to quickly setup a minimal-but-complete Buildcat
render farm on a single machine. Once you've gone through the process on a
single machine, the :ref:`advanced-setup` section will cover configuring a
full-fledged render farm spread across multiple machines.

.. tip::
    Make sure you read :ref:`design` and understand how the parts of a Buildcat
    farm work together before you start!

Shared Storage
--------------

The first step in setting-up your render farm will be to create or choose a
filesystem location for the shared storage space.  Throughout this
documentation we will refer to this location as BUILDCAT_ROOT.  Keep in mind
that BUILDCAT_ROOT must have enough storage for your projects, their assets
(geometry, textures, simulations, etc), and all of their rendered outputs, so
you'll want to pick a location on a disk with as much free space as possible.

For these examples, we'll assume that our BUILDCAT_ROOT is `/Volumes/Buildcat`.

Network Communication
---------------------

The next step in setting-up a render farm is identifying how your server, workers,
and clients will communicate with one another.  In particular, you need to know
the network address of the machine running your server.

Since our sample render farm will be running on one machine, we'll use the
loopback address - `127.0.0.1` as our server address throughout the rest of
this section.

Anaconda
--------

Now that we've selected BUILDCAT_ROOT and our network address, it's time to start
installing software.  We'll need Python and all of Buildcat's other dependencies.
Getting all of the pieces in place (and dealing with different platforms) is one of
the things that makes installing render farm software difficult.

Instead, whether youâ€™re new to Python or an old hand, we strongly recommend
installing `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_, a
minimalist subset of Anaconda.  Anaconda is a portable (OSX, Linux, and
Windows) Python distribution that you can use to conveniently install Python in
your home directory.  This is incredibly useful because installing the rest of
Buildcat's dependencies is easy and consistent across platforms, and you will
be leaving your system-provided Python in pristine condition.

The remainder of this documentation will assume that you have Anaconda
installed.  You can still obtain Buildcat's dependencies using other methods,
but you'll need to handle those details on your own.

Server
------

Now we're ready to install the Buildcat (Redis) server from a command line,
using Anaconda::

    $ conda install redis

Next, start Redis::

    $ redis-server

The Redis server will print some startup information to the console and wait
for connections::
    15455:C 05 Jul 2019 15:50:57.378 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo
    15455:C 05 Jul 2019 15:50:57.378 # Redis version=5.0.3, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=15455, just started
    15455:C 05 Jul 2019 15:50:57.378 # Warning: no config file specified, using the default config. In order to specify a config file use redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
    15455:M 05 Jul 2019 15:50:57.379 * Increased maximum number of open files to 10032 (it was originally set to 256).

                  `-.__.-'

    15455:M 05 Jul 2019 15:50:57.380 # Server initialized
    15455:M 05 Jul 2019 15:50:57.380 * Ready to accept connections

Note that Redis listens for connections on the loopback
address - `127.0.0.1` - by default, so we don't have to specify the network
address we choose earlier.  Leave Redis running, and open another command line
console to run the next set of commands.

Worker
------

Now we're ready to setup a worker.  First, we need to install the Python
client software for Redis, so our worker can communicate with the server.
Again, we'll use Anaconda to get it::

    $ conda install redis-py

Second, we'll install the RQ software that actually provides the worker process::

    $ pip install rq

(`pip` is a tool for installing Python software that's provided by Anaconda).

Next, we need to install the Buildcat software, which adds render-farm-specific
functionality to the vanilla RQ workers.  The following will install the most
recent stable release of Buildcat::

    $ pip install buildcat

Alternatively, if you're feeling lucky and want to use the latest,
bleeding-edge Buildcat goodness, you can install from source code::

    $ git clone https://github.com/shead-custom-design/buildcat
    $ cd buildcat
    $ python setup.py install

Finally, we're ready to run a worker::

    $ cd /Volumes/Buildcat
    $ rq worker -w buildcat.worker.Worker

The worker will print a startup message, begin communicating with the server,
and wait for jobs to work on::

    16:11:42 RQ worker 'rq:worker:b9031b3c338b4307b9764fe36e7de13a' started, version 1.0
    16:11:42 *** Listening on default...

Once again, leave the worker running and open
another command line console for the following steps.  Note that, before
starting the worker, we changed the working directory to BUILDCAT_ROOT.  This
way, the worker knows where BUILDCAT_ROOT is located, without having to
configure it, mess with registry entries, etc.

Testing
-------

Now it's time to test the farm.  To keep things simple, we're going to send
a command to the server directly instead of using your DCC application.  This
is the easiest way to ensure that everything's working.  First, open an interactive
Python interpreter::

    $ python

Next, open a connection to the server::

    >>> import rq, redis
    >>> queue = rq.Queue(connection=redis.Redis())

The `queue` object is what a DCC client integration would use to submit a render job.
In our case, we'll execute a simple command that Buildcat provides for testing::

    >>> queue.enqueue("buildcat.test.log", "Hello, World!")
    Job('e8fb5e4b-18bc-4e78-be81-1c4705f0e234', enqueued_at=datetime.datetime(2019, 7, 6, 0, 19, 17, 706162))

This command submits a `buildcat.test.log` job to the server, which hands it off to any
available worker.  If you check the console where we left our worker running, you'll see that it
accepted the job and ran it, printing `Hello, World!` to the console::

    18:19:17 default: buildcat.test.log('Hello, World!') (e8fb5e4b-18bc-4e78-be81-1c4705f0e234)
    18:19:17 INFO:buildcat:Hello, World!
    18:19:17 default: Job OK (e8fb5e4b-18bc-4e78-be81-1c4705f0e234)

Summary
-------

That's it!  Your single-machine render farm is up-and-running.  Of course,
there are many details we've skipped in this section, such as starting the farm
automatically when your machine boots.  In the :ref:`next section
<advanced-setup>` we'll make suggestions on how to handle startup, and cover
how to setup a multi-machine farm, and the section on :ref:`integrations` will
cover how to use a Buildcat render farm with specific DCC tools.
