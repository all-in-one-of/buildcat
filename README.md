Buildcat is the elegant, flexible, and lightweight build system that's
been struggling to escape monolithic tools like `make` and `SCons`.
Use Buildcat to process data, run scientific experiments, build documentation,
or handle any other build automation task.  Some key Buildcat features:

* Written in Python, called from Python: no new config file formats or DSLs to learn.
* Provides a library, not an executable: add it to existing scripts piecemeal, create your own front-ends, or integrate with an IDE if you like.
* *Doesn't* provide tools for C++ or Java compilation: you're automating building a PDF paper, another !@#$! `program.exe` sample isn't what you need.
* *Doesn't* assume all targets are on the filesystem: want to use a database record or a file stored in the cloud as a dependency?  Go for it.
